1.[PROBLEM] Segregate 0s and 1s in an array
[SOLUTION] Approach: Have two integers for zero and one, incrementing each based on the respective number in array.
Once array end is reached, print zero's and one's based on integers count.

Timecomplexity: O(n)

2.[PROBLEM] Segregate Even and Odd numbers
[SOLUTION]
n%2 == 0 -> Even
n%2 != 0 -> Odd

if only one output array should be used.
x=0;
y=n-1;
for(int i = 0; i< n; i++)
{
   if(a[i]%2 == 0)
    {
	   k[x] = a[i];
	   x = x+1;
	}
	else
	{
	  k[y] = a[i];
	  y = y - 1;
	}
}

3. [PROBLEM] Program to Count numbers on fingers
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-count-numbers-fingers/
Count the given numbers on your fingers and find the correct finger on which the number ends.

The first number starts from the thumb, second on the index finger, third on the middle finger, fourth on the ring finger and fifth on the little finger.
Again six comes on the ring finger and so on.
Examples:

Input : 17
Output :1

Input :27
Output :3
